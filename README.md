### Course: Algorithms and Data Structures

Welcome to the repository for my Algorithms and Data Structures project. This project is developed as part of the coursework at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Electrical Engineering.

## Project Overview

This project involves implementing basic data structures and operations on them. The primary focus is on the linear data structures, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues, and non-linear data structures such as trees and graphs.

### Key Features:
- **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure with push, pop and peek operations.
- **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure with insert, delete and front operations.
- **Tree**: Implementation of a n-ary tree that is represented in memory as a binary using an efficient technique with level-order traversal .
- **Graph**: Converting n-ary tree to a graph representation and detecting cycles in it using DFS traversal.

## Installation

You can clone this repository to your local development environment and run it from there. It's basic C++ code, so it will work as long as you compile and link your files correctly.
